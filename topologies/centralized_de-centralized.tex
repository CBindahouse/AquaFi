\section{Centralized versus De-Centralized}
In traditional WiFi there are two basic types of networks, a
centralized system where all stations connect
to a single access point, and a de-centralized
network where stations communicate peer-to-peer.

\subsection{Centralized}
A centralized system has a single point of failure, but allows
for simple routing as all communications go via the central
node.

\subsection{De-Centralized}
In a partial mesh we can add redundancy as at least two
nodes have two or more paths between them. This allows for packets
to be re-routed along a different path if a link fails. However, this
will require more hops for every packet, increasing latency.
