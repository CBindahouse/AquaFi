\section{Underwater Sensor Networks}
There has been some previous work on underwater sensor networks regarding
topologies.

In \cite{a_review_on_underwater_wireless_sensor_networks} they classify networks
into two groups. The first are static sensors anchored after deployment, and the
second are mobile sensors, free floating. They also further split these into
two dimensional or three dimensional. They describe networks in two
dimensional space as grid, cluster, free or linear topologies.

In \cite{uwsn_applications_challenges_design_issues} two types of networks are
described - ad hoc and hierachy. In ad hoc mode they are organised in a
\ac{P2P} network, which can further be divided into point to point and
multi-hop.
